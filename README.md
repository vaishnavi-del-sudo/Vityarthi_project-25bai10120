# Vityarthi_project-25bai10120

Project Title-
    Digit Sequence Index Finder

Overview of the project-
    The project is a command-line Python script that first separates the numbers and forms a list to give out the number with     the asked nth(input) digit in it(e.g., "123456789101112..."). The program prompts the user for the desired index and          efficiently computes the corresponding digit, demonstrating control structures and algorithmic sequence logic using           Python.​

Features-
    To accept user input for any target index and perform conversions from numbers to number separated list and then back to      the number, till 4 digit numbers (9999).
    Efficiently computes the digit for large indices without generating the complete sequence.
    Handles different index ranges with optimized calculations.
    Outputs both the target digit and optionally the digit sequence up to that point for verification.​

Technologies/tools used-
    Python 3.13
    Standard Python libraries 
    {if/elif statement, int to str, str to int, arithmetic operations(/,%,*,**,+), indexing, lists,variables}
 
 Steps to Install & Run the Project-
    Ensure Python 3.13 is installed on your computer.
    Download or copy the script file (e.g., vityarthi_project.py) to your machine.
    Open a terminal (Command Prompt or similar).
    Navigate to the folder containing the script.

Instructions for testing- 
    The input for the program must be in the designated range only (1,3889).
    Test common inputs (e.g., 5, 10, 12, 1000) to verify expected output.
    Try edge cases (e.g., 1, 9, a large index) to check correctness and performance.
    Invalid or non-integer inputs should be avoided unless error handling is further developed.​
    Compare the program’s output with manual calculations or known sequences to ensure accuracy.

Sample Output-
    n1(input)=100
    (the 100th digit as per separated list is tens place 5 in 55.) 
    output=
    5
    55
