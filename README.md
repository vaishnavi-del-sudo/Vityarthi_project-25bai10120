# Vityarthi_project-25bai10120

Project title- Digit to number printer
Overview of the project-The program first separates the numbers and forms a list to give out the number with the asked nth(input) digit in it. 
Features-The program is designed to perform conversions from numbers to number separated list and then back to the number, till 4 digit numbers (9999).
Technologies/tools used- if/elif statement, int to str, str to int, arithmetic operations(/,%,*,**,+), indexing, lists,variables
Instructions for testing- Beware of wrong indentation. And variables in vs code or system python software. 
The input for the program must be in the designated range only (1,3889).
Project Title
Digit Sequence Index Finder

Overview of the Project
This project is a command-line Python script that calculates and extracts the digit at a specified index from a growing numerical sequence formed by concatenating positive integers (e.g., "123456789101112..."). The program prompts the user for the desired index and efficiently computes the corresponding digit, demonstrating control structures and algorithmic sequence logic using Python.​

Features
Accepts user input for any target index.

Efficiently computes the digit for large indices without generating the complete sequence.

Handles different index ranges with optimized calculations.

Outputs both the target digit and optionally the digit sequence up to that point for verification.​

Technologies/Tools Used
Python 3.x

Standard Python libraries (no external dependencies)

Command-line interface​

Steps to Install & Run the Project
Ensure Python 3 is installed on your computer.

Download or copy the script file (e.g., vityarthi_project.py) to your machine.

Open a terminal (Command Prompt or similar).

Navigate to the folder containing the script.

Run the script using:

text
python vityarthi_project.py
When prompted, enter the index value at which you want to view the digit.

Instructions for Testing
Test common inputs (e.g., 5, 10, 12, 1000) to verify expected output.

Try edge cases (e.g., 1, 9, a large index) to check correctness and performance.

Invalid or non-integer inputs should be avoided unless error handling is further developed.​

Compare the program’s output with manual calculations or known sequences to ensure accuracy.

Screenshots (Recommended)
Sample interaction (replace with actual screenshots if available):

text
Enter the index till which digits should be printed: 12
1
[
Example:
n1(input)=100
the 100th digit as per separated list is tens place 5 in 55. 
output=
5
55
#this program works on the concept of lists and indexing, with alongside use of if and elif statements.
