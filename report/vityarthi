2. Introduction
This project implements a Python solution to determine and print the sequence of digits at a specific index in a mathematical digit series, based on user input. The program demonstrates concepts of indexing, mathematical calculations, and sequence handling in Python.​

3. Problem Statement
The primary objective is to create a program that, for a given index input, efficiently calculates and outputs the corresponding sequence of digits in a concatenated numerical series.​

4. Functional Requirements
Take integer input indicating the target index.

Generate and process sequences of digits to reach the desired index.

Output the digits at and around the target index for analysis.​

5. Non-functional Requirements
Program must run in Python 3 or later.

Execution should complete within seconds for typical indices (e.g., n < 10,000).

Basic error handling for invalid input formats.

6. System Architecture
The program uses a single Python script, working primarily within the command-line interface. All calculations and logic are self-contained, meaning no external dependencies or databases are required.​

7. Design Diagrams

Class/Component Diagram
One main functional block handling input, storage, and output.

ER Diagram
Not applicable; no persistent data or database storage used.

8. Design Decisions & Rationale
The solution uses loops and indexing to compute the required digit sequence, balancing simplicity and efficiency without external libraries. Logic branches handle varying index ranges for optimized calculation and output.​

9. Implementation Details
Input is received via input() for index specification.

List structures are used to store and process sequences.

Conditional statements handle multiple calculation cases based on index ranges.

Final output printed directly for user inspection.​

10. Screenshots / Results
Sample output (text format):

text
Enter the index till which digits should be printed: 15
[Output sequence shown here]
(Screenshots should be captured by running the program.)

11. Testing Approach
Manual testing by inputting different index values and verifying the correctness of the output sequences for each scenario.​

12. Challenges Faced
Handling large indices efficiently.

Designing logic for various index ranges to avoid calculation errors.

13. Learnings & Key Takeaways
Importance of control structures for sequence logic.

How to implement digit manipulation algorithms within procedural programming.

14. Future Enhancements
Add graphical user interface.

Optimize algorithm for extremely large indices.

Implement additional sequence types (e.g., prime number concatenation).
